     <p>Kazakhstan possesses vast territory and rich natural resources. Just like any country nowadays Kazakhstan focuses on socio-economic development which negatively impacts on the environment. The worst environmental issues in Kazakhstan:<p>

      <li>The shrinking of the Aral sea and Balkhash lake.</li>
      <li>Air polution in Almaty and Nur-Sultan.</li>
      <li>Recycling.</li>
      <li>Urban pollution.</li>
      </ul>
